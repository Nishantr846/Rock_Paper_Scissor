# Rock_Paper_Scissor
This simple C++ program is a console-based implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." It allows the user to play against the computer. The program utilizes random number generation and basic user input to determine the winner of each round.

#How to Play
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler. For example, if you are using g++, you can run:


Follow the on-screen instructions to select your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) by entering a number from 1 to 3.

The computer will randomly select its choice.

The program will display the result of the game - whether you won, lost, or it's a tie.

You'll be asked if you want to play again (type 'y' for yes and 'n' for no).

#How It Works
The program uses the C++ Standard Library to generate a random number to represent the computer's choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). It then compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner.

If the user's choice is the same as the computer's choice, it's a tie.
If the user's choice beats the computer's choice, the user wins.
If the computer's choice beats the user's choice, the computer wins.
